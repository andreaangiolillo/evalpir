Evaluation of Personalized Information Retrieval

The project allows to evaluate Personalised Information Retrieval Systems by using the collection defined in http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1866/invited_paper_18.pdf.
In order to run the software, three .csv files are required:
1) the systems' output
2) the relevant documents
3) the logsfile
